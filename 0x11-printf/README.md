# 0x11 - printf() in C
This Project involves implementation of the `printf` function in C Programming Language

## Collaborators
 - Idris Adebowale
 - Olorundamisi Dunmade

### Notes:
- The `_printf` function works as it is but betty still complains because the lenght is over 40 lines
hence there's need to probably write another function that takes care of the format printing
- To run it we need to create our `main.h` header file and make it gurarded then write test
main file which we must remove before running the checker again"
- I have decided to split the `_printf` function into separate "sub-functions".
- This way, we are able to simply add usecases to the main function
- Also, please try to see if you can contribute as well.
